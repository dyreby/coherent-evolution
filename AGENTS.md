# Agents

## Scratchpad

A `SCRATCHPAD.md` file may exist in the repo root. It's gitignored working memory for agent sessions — disposable context like model suggestions, open questions, and session notes.

Read it at session start if it exists. Update it when there's context worth carrying forward. Don't treat it as authoritative.
