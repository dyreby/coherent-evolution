# Coherent Evolution

A model for staying aligned as software evolves.

Building software involves deciding what to do and how to do it, at every level from the problem it's solving to tabs versus spaces.
When people build software together, staying aligned as the project changes is hard.

Coherent Evolution makes that visible, so teams can align where it matters and work independently where it doesn't.

## The model

Every level has a *what* (the intent) and a *how* (the approach).
Each *how* becomes the *what* for the level below it.
Fewer people are involved at each successive level, until the work is yours alone.

## What it's for

Teams building software together that want shared alignment without prescribed process.
It's a useful framing for when the same friction keeps reappearing, when it's hard to explain why a change feels bigger than it looks, or when people seem to be talking past each other.

## What it isn't

Coherent Evolution is not a process framework, not governance, not a replacement for domain expertise.
It is a shared language for locating alignment problems, not a system for managing them.
