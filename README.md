# Coherent Evolution

A model for building software together.

Software involves decisions at different levels — why the project exists, what it's trying to accomplish, how it gets built, and the code itself. Coherent Evolution makes those levels explicit so you can find the one where alignment lives and the work gets light.

## The Levels

- **Charter** — why the project exists
- **Vision** — what serves that purpose today
- **Design** — how it gets built
- **Implementation** — the code to do it

Each level constrains the next. Change means something different depending on where it lands: implementation changes are the work, design changes are learning, vision changes are growth, charter changes mean a new project.

## What It's For

Teams — human, agent-assisted, or mixed — that want shared alignment without prescribed process. It's useful when debates keep happening at the wrong level, when the same friction keeps reappearing, or when it's hard to explain why a change feels bigger than it looks.

## What It Isn't

Not a process framework. No ceremonies, no cadences, no required artifacts. Agile, TDD, DDD, ADRs — these fit comfortably alongside it. CE is a coherence layer, not a replacement.
