# Charter v1

Coherent Evolution is a pattern for evolving projects consciously.

Projects begin with a charter — an invariant statement of purpose.
A versioned vision captures how the project serves that purpose today.

Charter constrains vision. Vision constrains design.
Design lives downstream and is disposable.

If the charter fundamentally changes, that's a new project.
If the vision evolves, that's growth.
If the design changes, that's just work.
