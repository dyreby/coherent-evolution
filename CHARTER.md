Software development involves deciding what to build and how to build it.
Those decisions happen at every level, from what problem we're solving to tabs versus spaces.
When people build software together, alignment across those levels is hard to maintain over time.
Coherent Evolution is a model that helps people stay aligned as the software evolves.
