# Vision

Coherent Evolution models software as levels of care.

**Charter** — Why we're here
**Vision** — What serves that purpose today
**Design** — How it gets built
**Implementation** — The code to do it

Charter constrains vision. Vision constrains design. Design constrains implementation. Each layer contains its own why, what, and how — all the way down to tabs vs. spaces.

If the charter changes, that's a new project. If the vision evolves, that's growth. If the design changes, that's learning. If the implementation changes, that's the work.

Not everyone needs or wants to care about everything, and that's a gift, not a gap. Share the understanding, build the trust, and you can do what you love and call it work.
