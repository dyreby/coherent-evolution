# Vision

Every project involves decisions from why it exists to how the code is written. Coherent Evolution is a model that makes those levels explicit so you can focus on the ones that matter to you.

- Charter — Why we're here
- Vision — What serves that purpose today
- Design — How it gets built
- Implementation — The code to do it

Each level contains its own why, what, and how, and constrains the next — all the way down to tabs vs. spaces.

Change means different things at different levels. When the charter changes, that's a new project. When the vision evolves, that's growth. When the design changes, that's learning. When the implementation changes, that's the work.

Not everyone needs or wants to care about every level, and that's a gift, not a gap. Share the understanding, build the trust, and you can do what you love and call it work.

What makes this possible is shared artifacts at each level — a charter, a vision, design documents, whatever fits the project. These are artifacts of clarity, not procedures of compliance. The point is having something you can point to that captures alignment, not following a prescribed process to produce it.

## Success Criteria

Observable indicators that coherent evolution is working:

- Changes can be clearly classified by level. When someone proposes a change, it's obvious whether it touches charter, vision, design, or implementation.
- Wrong-level conflicts decrease. Design disagreements stop masquerading as implementation debates. Charter tensions stop surfacing as design friction.
- Implementation pain surfaces design flaws without destabilizing everything. The levels contain blast radius — a broken abstraction doesn't trigger an existential conversation.
- Alignment reduces cognitive load. Contributors can explain their level's goals without reciting the charter. The levels create natural boundaries for what you need to hold in your head.

## Non-Goals

What Coherent Evolution explicitly avoids:

- **Prescribing process.** Coherent Evolution doesn't tell you how to work — no ceremonies, cadences, or workflows. It's a model for understanding change, not a methodology for managing it.
- **Defining governance.** Coherent Evolution identifies what kind of change is happening, not who gets to make it. Authority and ownership structures are yours to define.
- **Replacing domain expertise.** Coherent Evolution is a lens, not a substitute. Knowing that a change is at the design level doesn't tell you what the right design is.
- **Standardizing structure.** Coherent Evolution doesn't require specific file layouts, document formats, or organizational hierarchies. The artifacts are yours to shape.
