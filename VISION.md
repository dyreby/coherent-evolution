# Vision

Coherent Evolution models software as levels of care.

- Charter — Why we're here
- Vision — What serves that purpose today
- Design — How it gets built
- Implementation — The code to do it

Each level contains its own why, what, and how, and constrains the next — all the way down to tabs vs. spaces.

Change means different things at different levels. When the charter changes, that's a new project. When the vision evolves, that's growth. When the design changes, that's learning. When the implementation changes, that's the work.

Not everyone needs or wants to care about every level, and that's a gift, not a gap. Share the understanding, build the trust, and you can do what you love and call it work.
